# neural-style-transfer
Implementing neural style transfer algorithm with Tensorflow, and testing it on my painting. The notebook is adapted from [Tensorflow's style transfer tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/style_transfer). 

This project is used to demonstrate the use of the [Link extension](https://link.makinarocks.ai/index.html) in a data science/ ML project. Please check out my Youtube video here for details: https://youtu.be/fClT4PWlGoA

#### Note:
- If you haven't installed Tensorflow and you're using an M1 Macbook like me, you may want to follow [this guide](https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/) to install Tensorflow.
- This [thread](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/705987) also helped me a lot with trouble-shooting some issue with loading the library on a Mac.
